# Brain-to-speech decoder
On-going research project that compares models for reconstructing low-frequency amplitude envelopes from listeners' EEG signals, including models based on the multivariate temporal response function (mTRF) and deep neural networks including LSTM layers. Scripts unfinished and will be updated.
